# Lean4 Formalization Of Polynomial Functors

This repository is a [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) formalization of the theory of Polynomial Functors. Polynomial Functors categorify 
polynomials. 

## Acknowledgment 
The work has been done during the Trimester Program "Prospects of formal mathematics" at the Hausdorff Institute (HIM) in Bonn. 

## Content (under development)

As part of this formalization, we also formalize locally cartesian closed categories in Lean4.
