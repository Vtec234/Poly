# Lean4 Formalization Of Fibred Categories

This repository is a [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) formalization of the theory of Polynomial Functors. Polynomial Functors categorify 
polynomials. 

## Acknowledgment 
The work has been done during the Trimester Program "Prospects of formal mathematics" at the Hausdorff Institute (HIM) in Bonn. 

## Content (under development)

As part of this formalization, we also formalize locally cartesian closed categories in Lean4. 

- [] The basic of polynomial functors as endofunctors of the category of types, and their arithmetic (sum, product, composition).
  - [x] Definition of polynomials and the associated polynomial functors as endofunctors of the category of types
  - [x] Sums of polynomaials 
  - [x] Composition of polynomials
- [] Polynomial functos in locally cartesian closed categories.
    - [x] Definition of locally cartesian closed category.
